# Industrial Sawmill
Updated for FS25, this is THE sawmill to have on your farm, and will be the first of many custom models that I will be pushing up to ModHub. Thank you to my channel supporters for helping purchase this model, and allowing me to get a wood mill out for all platforms! For FS25, we've also added a bunch of features like a pallet buying point (in case you don't want to do the work), and a "warehouse" version that is both a buypoint and sellpoint (similar to the warehouses in base-game).

The "rusty" version is still there, but now in the customization menu allowing a single store item to have both versions.

Included in this mod is a color adjustment to the standard yellow wanrning stripes to match the game "green" colors - the green side will always be the "sell" side, and the yellow side will be the "spawn" side. This is will be a standard across all of my mod to help the player visually distinguish between spawning and selling triggers.
